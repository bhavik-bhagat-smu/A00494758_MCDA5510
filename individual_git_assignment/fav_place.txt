While touring North India in 2011, I visited a place called Dalhousie located in the state of Himachal Pradesh.


It was most memorable experience of my life, as first time I experieced a sub-zero temperature.
I also experieced the snowfall for the first time there, and skiing in the snow with all the gear was fun!
